## About Cuis

Cuis is an Open Source, multiplatform [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) system.

What sets Cuis apart from the other Smalltalk systems is the focus on the original values of the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC, and an active attitude towards system complexity: Keep it to a minimum.
