# Cuis Smalltalk v.6.2 Stable Release

## About Cuis

Cuis is an Open Source, multiplatform [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) system.

What sets Cuis apart from the other Smalltalk systems is the focus on the original values of the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC, and an active attitude towards system complexity: Keep it to a minimum.

## Running Cuis

The easiest way to download and run Cuis is to download the [Zip file](https://codeload.github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis6-2/zip/refs/heads/main). Or you can just clone this Git repo.

Double click on it to unzip, then run the appropriate start script (RunCuisOnWindows.bat, RunCuisOnLinux.sh, CuisVM.app). To start Cuis on a Mac from Terminal, run RunCuisOnMac.sh.

Note: On Mac, if you dowloaded the Zip File, you'll likely need to open a Terminal on the Cuis folder, and run ./unquarantine.sh . This is needed for macOS to allow running an application extracted from a Zip file.
